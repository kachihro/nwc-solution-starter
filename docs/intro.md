# Overview

This documentation will guide you through building and installing the Nintex Solution Starter in SharePoint Online, or SharePoint on-premesis, as well as some simple customization.

To get started, you should first build and install the basic app, and add the web part to a page:
1. [Build the app](./build.md).
1. [Install the app in your SharePoint environment](./install.md).
1. [Add the web part to a page](./addToPage.md).

Once you have successfully installed and added the web part, you may want to customize the columns and fields. See the [basic customisation guidelines](./customize.md).

Then, there are some more specific guides on how to:  
  - [Change a column heading or size](./columnsRenameResize.md).
  - [Change the order of the columns](./columnsReorder.md).
  - [Add or remove a column](./columnsAddRemove.md).
